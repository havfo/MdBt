MdBt

MdBt is an irc bot that sits on a channel and responds when spoken to.
It learns from the conversations using 4th order markov chains to represent
the data. It also supports plugins that can be loaded at runtime (see
MdBtPlugins).

It has no external dependencies and can be imported directly into your
favourite IDE.

Have fun!
